# Statistics Curator brand images

Home Assistant core serves `custom_components/<domain>/brand/<image>.png` directly, so these files show up in the UI and in HACS with no submission to the `home-assistant/brands` repository.

| File | Size |
| --- | --- |
| `icon.png` / `icon@2x.png` | 256x256 / 512x512 |
| `logo.png` / `logo@2x.png` | 864x256 / 1728x512 |
| `dark_icon.png` / `dark_icon@2x.png` | 256x256 / 512x512 |
| `dark_logo.png` / `dark_logo@2x.png` | 864x256 / 1728x512 |

The mark is three statistics bars on one baseline. Stale history crumbles off the first bar into small squares, and an amber tick marks the rest as settled. Flat colour, no text in the icon; the logo adds the "Statistics Curator" wordmark.

All eight PNGs are rendered by `tools/render_brand.py` (Pillow only, deterministic; the vector twin is `icon.svg` at the repo root). Do not edit the PNGs by hand: change the script and re-run it.

`dark_*` variants use a pale plate with a blue mark so they keep their contrast on the dark Home Assistant header; the light variants use a blue plate with a white mark.
